# World Exploration Table

This project is a React.js web application that consumes a GraphQL endpoint to display country data and provides interactive features like sorting, filtering, and data visualization.


## Project Description

The project demonstrates the consumption of a GraphQL endpoint from [APIs-guru/graphql-apis](https://countries.trevorblades.com/). It utilizes React.js for the frontend, Shadcn/ui for the user interface components, and Tailwind CSS for styling. 

The application provides a table view with sorting, filtering, and basic interactions. When a filter selection is made, the data is reflected in both the Nivo pie chart and the table. The chart displays country names organized according to continent and language.

Additionally, it includes a summary display upon selection of a row and basic data visualization based on the GraphQL endpoint used.
